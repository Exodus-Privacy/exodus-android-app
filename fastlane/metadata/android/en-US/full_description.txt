Exodus helps you to know which trackers and permissions are embedded in apps installed on your device.

The app downloads reports from the Îµxodus platform (https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/) and shows them to you app by app.

This application is developed by the French non-profit organization Exodus Privacy, visit us at https://exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/.
